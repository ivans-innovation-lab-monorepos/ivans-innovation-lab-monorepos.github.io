The source code of this lab is open, and hosted on Github within the ['ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos' organziation](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos). 

Github organization is structured in two repos:
- [Backend](https://ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos.github.io/my-company-backend) (Java, Spring, Axonframework)
- [Frontend](https://ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos.github.io/my-company-frontend) (TypeScript, Angular, Nrwl)

## [Backend](https://ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos.github.io/my-company-backend)
Exposes a REST API to be consumed by [internal employees or partners](http://idugalic.pro/2017-12-26-API-Strategy/).

Apache Maven is used as a project management and comprehension tool. Maven supports project aggregation in addition to project inheritance. Maven processes projects with multiple modules so you can work with them more effectively.

### Patterns and techniques

- Domain Driven Design
- Command and Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)
- Event Sourcing


## [Frontend](https://ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos.github.io/my-company-frontend)
It conusumes a [REST API](https://ivans-innovation-lab-monorepos.github.io/my-company-backend#run-monolith).

Application is generated with Angular CLI and [Nrwl](https://nrwl.io/nx) extensions for Angular. 

Instead of having a large monolith, we have dozens of small libraries with well-defined public APIs (and an Nx Workspace ensures you only use your librariesâ€™ public APIs). The libraries are hosting Angular modules.

### Patterns and techniques

- Atomic design
- Feature Components vs Presentational Components
