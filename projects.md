This application is generated with Angular CLI and [Nrwl](https://nrwl.io/nx) extensions for Angular. 

Instead of having a large monolith, we have dozens of small libraries with well-defined public APIs (and an Nx Workspace ensures you only use your librariesâ€™ public APIs). The libraries are hosting Angular modules.
